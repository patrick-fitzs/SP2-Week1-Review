/**
 * Q24. (*) Java provides three types of loops: while, for, and do (also called do-while).
 * Theoretically, they are interchangeable â€” any program you write with one kind of loop
 * could be rewritten using any of the other types of loops. As a practical matter, though,
 * it is often the case that choosing the right kind of loop will make your code easier to
 * produce, debug, and read.
 * It takes time and experience to learn to make the best loop choice, so this exercise
 * gives you some of that experience. Rewrite the program from Question 23 using a for
 * loop. Repeat the exercise again but this time use a do-while loop.
 * Which form of loop seems to work best and why?
